# Telecom_customer_churn_Prediction.
**Introduction**
The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of customers leaving a telecom company. The project is developed using Python programming language and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.<br>

**Problem Statement**
The telecom industry is highly competitive, and retaining customers is one of the main challenges. Customer churn is a major problem for telecom companies as it impacts their revenue and growth. Therefore, predicting customer churn is essential for telecom companies to take necessary actions and prevent customers from leaving.<br>

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, which contains 7,043 observations and 21 variables. The variables include customer demographics, services availed, and customer churn status.<br>

**Methodology**
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The following steps are involved in the project:<br>

+ Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates.<br>
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns.<br>
+ Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by converting categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques.<br>
+ Feature Selection: Selecting the features<br>
+ Model Selection: Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated to select the best model for prediction.<br>
+ Evaluation: The performance of the selected model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.<br>
<br>
*Machine Learning Models*<br>
The following machine learning models are used in this project:<br>
+ Logistic Regression<br>
+ Decision Tree<br>
+ Random Forest<br>
